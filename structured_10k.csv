The Companys reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Companys other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Companys customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.Markets and DistributionThe Companys customers are primarily in the consumer, small and midsized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as thirdparty cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2024, the Companys net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 38 and 62, respectively, of total net sales.CompetitionThe markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Companys products and infringing on its intellectual property.Apple Inc.  2024 Form 10K  2The Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features including security features, relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong thirdparty software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Companys competitors have broader product lines, lowerpriced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Companys services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Companys product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.Supply of ComponentsAlthough most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements.The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.Research and DevelopmentBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development RD, licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of thirdparty businesses and technology.Intellectual PropertyThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.The Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.In addition to Companyowned intellectual property, many of the Companys products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Companys products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.Apple Inc.  2024 Form 10K  3Business Seasonality and Product IntroductionsThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.Human CapitalThe Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain the best talent. The Company works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members, so that its people can do the best work of their lives. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had approximately 164,000 fulltime equivalent employees.Compensation and BenefitsThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Companys success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world, including health, wellness and time away.Growth and DevelopmentThe Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers programs through Apple University on leadership, management and influence, as well as Apple culture and values. Team members can also take advantage of online classes for business, technical and personal development, as well as learning opportunities to support their wellbeing.Workplace Practices and PoliciesThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.Inclusion and DiversityThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.EngagementThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.Health and SafetyThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially highhazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team.Apple Inc.  2024 Form 10K  4Available InformationThe Companys Annual Reports on Form 10K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10Q, Current Reports on Form 8K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13a and 15d of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act, are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC.

The Commissions investigations concern 1 Article 54 of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users and 2 Article 63 of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 54 investigation alleging that the Companys App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Companys new contractual requirements for thirdparty app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10 of the Companys annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commissions order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.Department of Justice LawsuitOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice the DOJ and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for performance smartphones and smartphones in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.Epic GamesEpic Games, Inc. Epic filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California the California District Court against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and Californias unfair competition law based upon the Companys operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Companys App Store Review Guidelines violate Californias unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple inapp purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Companys compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the Company has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.Other Legal ProceedingsThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above managements expectations, the Companys financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.",Mine Safety DisclosuresNot applicable.Apple Inc.  2024 Form 10K  18,"Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesThe Companys common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol AAPL.HoldersAs of October 18, 2024, there were 23,301 shareholders of record.Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated PurchasersShare repurchase activity during the three months ended September 28, 2024 was as follows in millions, except number of shares, which are reflected in thousands, and pershare amountsPeriodsTotal Numberof Shares PurchasedAverage PricePaid Per ShareTotal Number of SharesPurchased as Part of PubliclyAnnounced Plans or ProgramsApproximate Dollar Value ofShares That May Yet Be PurchasedUnder the Plans or Programs 1June 30, 2024 to August 3, 2024Open market and privately negotiated purchases35,697 224.11 35,697 August 4, 2024 to August 31, 2024Open market and privately negotiated purchases42,910 221.39 42,910 September 1, 2024 to September 28, 2024Open market and privately negotiated purchases33,653 222.86 33,653 Total112,260 89,074 1As of September 28, 2024, the Company was authorized by the Board to purchase up to 110 billion of the Companys common stock under a share repurchase program announced on May 2, 2024, of which 20.9 billion had been utilized.

The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks however, they may still impact the Companys consolidated financial statements.Interest Rate RiskThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Companys investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Companys investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Companys term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.The following table sets forth potential impacts on the Companys investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 dollars in millionsInterest RateSensitive InstrumentHypothetical InterestRate IncreasePotential Impact20242023Investment portfolio100 basis points, all tenorsDecline in fair value2,755 3,089 Term debt100 basis points, all tenorsIncrease in annual interest expense139 194 Foreign Exchange Rate RiskThe Companys exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Companys assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.The Company applied a valueatrisk VAR model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Companys foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95 confidence, a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 538 million and 669 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Changes in the Companys underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Companys foreign currency derivatives.Apple

StatementsNote 1  Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of Presentation and PreparationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation.The Companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Companys fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Companys fiscal years 2024 and 2022 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Companys fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.RevenueThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities.ShareBased CompensationThe Company recognizes sharebased compensation expense on a straightline basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest.Cash EquivalentsAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash equivalents.Marketable SecuritiesThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.InventoriesInventories are measured using the firstin, firstout method.Property, Plant and EquipmentDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straightline basis.Derivative InstrumentsThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Income TaxesThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the TCJA.LeasesThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail facilities.Apple Inc.  2024 Form 10K  34Note 2  RevenueThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Companys Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Companys Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Companys expectations and historical experience.For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices SSPs. When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Companys best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis. The Companys process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, productspecific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.The Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac and iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive certain productrelated bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for productrelated bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Companys estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to productrelated bundled services is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.For certain longterm service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.For the sale of thirdparty products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of thirdparty products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For thirdparty applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all thirdparty applicationrelated sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows in millions202420232022iPhone201,183 200,583 205,489 Mac29,984 29,357 40,177 iPad26,694 28,300 29,292 Wearables, Home and Accessories37,005 39,845 41,241 Services 196,169 85,200 78,129 Total net sales391,035 383,285 394,328 1Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.Total net sales include 7.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023, 8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, and 7.5 billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021.Apple Inc.  2024 Form 10K  35The Companys proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 13, Segment Information and Geographic Data for 2024, 2023 and 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of 12.8 billion and 12.1 billion, respectively.

However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.Foreign Exchange Rate RiskTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges.

The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and ProductAlthough most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements.Substantially all of the Companys hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.Note 13  Segment Information and Geographic DataThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Companys other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Companys customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Companys retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information provided to the Companys chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions and assessing segment performance excludes asset information.Apple Inc.  2024 Form 10K  46The following table shows information by reportable segment for 2024, 2023 and 2022 in millions202420232022AmericasNet sales167,045 162,560 169,658 Operating income67,656 60,508 62,683 EuropeNet sales101,328 94,294 95,118 Operating income41,790 36,098 35,233 Greater ChinaNet sales66,952 72,559 74,200 Operating income27,082 30,328 31,153 JapanNet sales25,052 24,257 25,977 Operating income12,454 11,888 12,257 Rest of Asia PacificNet sales30,658 29,615 29,375 Operating income13,062 12,066 11,569 A reconciliation of the Companys segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2024, 2023 and 2022 is as follows in millions202420232022Segment operating income162,044 150,888 152,895 Research and development expense31,37029,91526,251Other corporate expenses, net 17,4586,6727,207Total operating income123,216 114,301 119,437 1Includes general and administrative compensation costs, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed costs.The following tables show net sales for 2024, 2023 and 2022 and longlived assets as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 for countries that individually accounted for 10 or more of the respective totals, as well as aggregate amounts for the remaining countries in millions202420232022Net salesU.S.142,196 138,573 147,859 China 166,952 72,559 74,200 Other countries181,887 172,153 172,269 Total net sales391,035 383,285 394,328 20242023Longlived assetsU.S.35,664 33,276 China 14,797 5,778 Other countries5,219 4,661 Total longlived assets45,680 43,715 1China includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.Apple Inc.  2024 Form 10K  47Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.Opinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. the Company as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024, and the related notes collectively referred to as the financial statements.

A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.s Ernst  Young LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaNovember 1, 2024Apple Inc.  2024 Form 10K  50",Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone.,"Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 28, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is i recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Inherent Limitations over Internal ControlsThe Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Companys assetsiiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and directors andiiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Companys internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingThe Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a15f under the Exchange Act.
